        <p>Environment means anything that surrounds us. It can be living (biotic) or non-living (abiotic) things.</p>
        <p>It includes physical, chemical and other natural forces. Living things live in their environment. They constantly interact with it and adapt themselves to conditions in their environment. In the environment there are different interactions between animals, plants, soil, water, and other living and non-living things.</p>
        <p>Describtion of some important elements is given below:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Trees are useful to man in three very important ways. They provide him with wood and other products, They give him shade and they help to prevent drought and floods. Trees bear a great impact on the climate.</li>
            <li>Air is the mixture of gases that forms the earth's atmosphere. At sea level dry air has a density of 1.226 kilograms per cubic metre and consists of 78.08 per cent nitrogen, 20.95 per cent oxygen, 0.93 per cent argon, 0.03 per cent carbon dioxide, with smaller quantities of ozone and inert gases; water vapour varies between 0 and 4 per cent and in industrial areas sulphur gases may be present as pollutants</li>
            <li>Water, an important element of human environment, is essential for human and plant life. Water is called life. It is next to air.</li>
            <li>Soil is the uppermost layer of earthâ€™s surface which supports all forms of life. It is in the soil that all plants have their roots and from which they absorb life-sustaining moisture and nutrients.</li>
            <li>Countries of the world rely heavily on petroleum, coal and natural gas for their energy sources. There are two mejor types of energy sources: renewable and non-renewable. </li>
