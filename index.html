        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>Our environment is nature’s most precious and vital gift, which needs to be handled with utmost care. It is the natural ecological system where we live, depending on each other for survival. The environment is divided into physical and biological components. </p>
        <p>The atmosphere, lithosphere and hydrosphere constitute the physical category, and the biological category comprises human beings and other living beings. In simple terms, the environment is defined as the combination and interrelation between all biotic and abiotic components. The ecosystem of our environment needs to be maintained in a proper balance, and if any part of it is disturbed, the whole ecosystem gets affected.</p>

        <p>Trees are the greatest gift nature has ever given to humans. They are the most important support for life. There would be no life on earth without trees. Trees help us in many ways. Not only humans but they are equally important for animals and birds.</p>
        <p>Without trees, the ecosystem of the planet will fall down. Trees also prevent floods and cause rain. In villages, people use the fallen branches of trees as fuel. We can only live along with trees. We can’t live without them.</p>

        <p>Air is the Earth's atmosphere. Air is a mixture of many gases and tiny dust particles. It is the clear gas in which living things live and breathe. It has an indefinite shape and volume. It has mass and weight, because it is matter. The weight of air creates atmospheric pressure. There is no air in outer space.</p>
        <p>Air is a mixture of about 78% nitrogen, 21% of oxygen, and 1% other gases, such as Carbon Dioxide.</p>

        <p>Soil is loose material which lies on top of the land. It has many things in it, like tiny grains of rock, minerals, water and air. Soil also has living things and dead things in it: "organic matter". Soil is important for life on Earth.</p>
        <p>Because soil holds water and nutrients, it is an ideal place for plants to grow.[1] Soil holds the roots, and lets plants stand above the ground to collect the light they need to live.</p>
